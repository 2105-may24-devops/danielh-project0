# MyLeagueManager

MyLeagueManager is a sport league management application, which allows users to create and delete leagues, as well as simulate seasons of play. 
The application achieves this by leveraging the file system for reading/writing data. Deployment support to multiple virtual machines is automated, 
including configuration of a virtual environment, installation, launching, retrieval of program logs, and uninstallation.


Application can be launched with the proj0.py file.  Logs are saved within the gamefiles directory.
